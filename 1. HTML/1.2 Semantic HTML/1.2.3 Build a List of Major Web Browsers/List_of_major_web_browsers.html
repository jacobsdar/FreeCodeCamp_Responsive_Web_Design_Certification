### Step 1

In this workshop, you are going to build a list of major web browsers.
The HTML boilerplate has been provided for you.

Start by adding a heading to your page that reads List of Major Web Browsers using a
h1 element inside the body element.

### Step 2

As you recall from an earlier lesson, description lists are used to present terms
and definitions in an organized and easy-to-read format.

Here is an example:

Example Code
<dl>
  <dt>HTML</dt>
  <dd>HyperText Markup Language</dd>
  <dt>CSS</dt>
  <dd>Cascading Style Sheets</dd>
</dl>

Below the h1 element, create a dl element. This will hold the list of browsers.

### Step 3

Description lists are made up of a list of terms and details.
The dt element represents the description term, while the dd element represents the
description detail.

The first browser you will add to your description list will be for Google Chrome.

Inside your dl element, add a dt element containing the text Google Chrome.

Below your dt element, add a dd element with the following text:

```
Example Code
This is a free web browser developed by Google and first released in 2008.
```
### Step 4

Now it is time to add your second browser to the list.

Below your Google Chrome entry, add another dt element containing the text Firefox.

Below your dt element, add a dd element with the following text:

```
Example Code
This is a free web browser developed by the Mozilla Corporation and first created in 2004.
```

### Step 5

The third browser you will add to the list will be for the Safari web browser.

Add another dt element containing the text Safari.

Below your dt element, add a dd element with the following text:

```
Example Code
This browser was developed by Apple and is the default
```

### Step 6

Now it is time to add your fourth browser to the list.

Add another dt element containing the text Brave.

Below your dt element, add a dd element with the following text:

```
Example Code
This is a free web browser first released in 2016 that is based on the Chromium web browser.
```

### Step 7

The last browser you will add to the list will be for the Arc browser.

Add another dt element containing the text Arc.

Below your dt element, add a dd element with the following text:

```
Example Code
This is a free Chromium based web browser first released in 2023 by The Browser Company.
```
