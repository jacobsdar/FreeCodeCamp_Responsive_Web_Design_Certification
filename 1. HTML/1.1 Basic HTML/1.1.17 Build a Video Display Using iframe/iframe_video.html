### Step 1

In this workshop, you will use the iframe element to display a video.
The basic HTML boilerplate has been prepared for you.

Begin by creating an h1 element with the text iframe Video Display.

### Step 2

Now, create an iframe element. Don't put anything in it yet.

### Step 3

In the first lesson on the iframe element,
you learned it's a replaced element just like img.
That means it can also take the width and height properties to determine how tall
and wide it should be.

Give your iframe element a width of 560 and a height of 315.

### Step 4

The iframe element also takes an src attribute with a
value that indicates the URL or the path of the resource to display.

Add an src attribute of https://www.youtube.com/embed/I0_951_MPE0
to your iframe element.

At this point, you should see the video displaying on the page,
but there are some more attributes you need to add.

### Step 5

One of the attributes is allow.
It's like a permission list that tells the browser what features
the iframe is allowed to use.

Here's an iframe element with the allow attribute:

Example Code

<iframe
  allow="accelerometer autoplay clipboard-write encrypted-media gyroscope picture-in-picture web-share"
></iframe>\

Add the allow attribute with the value accelerometer, autoplay, and clipboard-write.

accelerometer lets the iframe use motion sensors
so it can detect things like device tilting and rotation.
autoplay lets the video start playing automatically,
and clipboard-write lets the iframe write data to the user’s clipboard.

### Step 6

Add encrypted-media, gyroscope, and web-share
to the existing values in the allow attribute.

These three will allow the use of encrypted media extensions to protect the video,
grant access to the device’s motion and orientation sensors,
and allow sharing the iframe content through the device's native share dialogs.

### Step 7

The next attribute you'll add is referrerpolicy.
It is the rule that determines how much detail you share when your page connects
to another page.

Add the referrerpolicy attribute and set it to strict-origin-when-cross-origin.
This shares the full address on the same site,
only the site name on other sites, and nothing on insecure sites.

### Step 8

Last but not least, the attribute you will add is allowfullscreen.
As it implies, it allows the video to be viewed in full screen mode.

With that, the workshop is completed!
