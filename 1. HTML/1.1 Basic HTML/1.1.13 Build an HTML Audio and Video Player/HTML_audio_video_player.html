3. Inside the first section element, you should have an h2 element
   for the title of the video playing.
4. Below the h2 element, you should have a video element
   with controls and width attributes. The width attribute should be set to 640.
5. Inside the video element, you should have a source element with a
   src attribute pointing to a video file and a type attribute.
6. You can use
   https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/labs/what-is-the-map-method-and-how-does-it-work.mp4.
7. Inside the second section element, you should have an h2 element for the
   title of the song playing.
